# 💫 About Me:
I graduated from the Computer Department of Süleyman Taştekin Vocational and Technical Anatolian High
School in İzmir. I completed the Computer Programming Department at Isparta Süleyman Demirel University
with a first-place ranking (3.4/4). I received Qualified IT Specialist training at Bilge Adam Academy. From
November 2021, I worked as a Backend Developer at Diten Technology, a subsidiary of Grand Medical Group. I
have completed my military service.
In July 2024, I started working as a Software Developer at Mikro Yazılım, part of Mikro Group. I am part of the
core team responsible for the integration between accounting software such as Parasut, Zirve, and Mikro with
the Turkish Revenue Administration (GIB).
I am dedicated to reflecting what I have learned in my career and school life into my business life. I will further
develop myself with the knowledge I gain from more experienced and knowledgeable people in my business
life. I am in a position where I can use my problem-solving skills in teamwork and dedicate time to learning
and developing myself. I want to continue progressing in this direction.<br>this.<br>
